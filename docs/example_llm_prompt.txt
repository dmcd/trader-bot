CONTEXT:
- Cooldown: clear
- Priority signal allowed: false
- Fee regime: normal
- Last trade age: 900s
- Equity: $10,000.00

RULES:
- If cooldown is active and priority signal is NOT allowed, you MUST return HOLD.
- If priority signal allowed = true, you may trade despite cooldown but size must be reduced and within caps.
- Always obey order cap and exposure cap; quantities must fit caps.
- Ensure trade value is at least $200.00.
- If fee regime is high, avoid churn: prefer HOLD or maker-first trades.
- Always use symbols from the Available Symbols list.
- Factor existing open orders into sizing/direction to avoid over-allocation or duplicate legs.
- You may return action=CANCEL with an order_id from the open orders list to pull a stale or unsafe order.

NOTE: You are running in SANDBOX/PAPER mode. The 'Portfolio Value' shown above represents the Profit/Loss (PnL) relative to the starting balance, NOT the total account value. It may be negative. This is expected. You still have sufficient capital to trade. Do NOT stop trading because of a negative Portfolio Value.
